My name is Grecia Macias and I love rock climbing :D !

To me, rock climbing is like trying to solve a puzzle where each step requires strategy and your time limit is dependent on your physical strength and endurance. There are three basic types of rock climbing available in most rock climbing gyms: Top Rope, Bouldering, and Lead.
